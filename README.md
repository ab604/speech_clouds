# Conference speech clouds
## A.Bailey 4th October 2017

A few speech clouds made using transcripts of [Jeremy Corbyn](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/09/jeremy-corbyns-labour-conference-speech-full-text/) 
and [Theresa May's](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/10/theresa-mays-conservative-conference-speech-full-text/) 
speeches from the 27th Sepetember and October 4th 2017 respectively.

I removed common words such as "and" as well as thew words "labour","conservative","tories", and "tory" to highlight
the important works.

## Plotting the speech clouds side by side
Spot the difference?! Corbyn on the left, May on the right. Of course.

## Commonality cloud

I used this [tutorial](https://rpubs.com/brandonkopp/creating-word-clouds-in-r) to make the clouds.
